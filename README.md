# swift-sovereign-states

Implement and use real-world regional divisions. I didn't want other people investing their time and energy on creating or paying for something like this, which is why it is licensed under the public domain and works offline.

## Requirements
* Swift >= 5.4
* iOS >= 13.0
* macOS >= 10.15
* tvOS >= 13.0
* watchOS >= 6.0

## Current Limitations
- only supports English localization
- only a few level-2 supported subdivisions

## Installation
### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'SwiftSovereignStates', '~> 1.2.1'

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/randomhashtags/swift-sovereign-states.git", from: "1.2.1"),
